Security Configuration such that the allow only users that are ldap(.ldif) which is only for testing purpose by using LDAP Authentication in Security Configuration.

Here’s a concise 7-step process for implementing **LDAP authentication** with **Spring Security**, which you can add to your LinkedIn README:

### Steps to Implement LDAP Authentication in Spring Security:

1. **Add Dependencies**: Include **Spring Security** and **Spring LDAP** starter dependencies in your project’s `pom.xml` .

2. **Configure LDAP Settings**: Set up LDAP server details in the `application.properties` file, specifying the LDAP base DN, port, and LDIF file.

3. **Set Up LDAP Context**: Define the LDAP context source to configure the LDAP server URL, base DN, and authentication credentials.

4. **Create Security Configuration**: Configure `HttpSecurity` to secure endpoints, enabling form-based or HTTP basic authentication for your application.

5. **Define User DN Patterns**: Specify the pattern to locate user entries in the LDAP directory (e.g., `uid={0},ou=people`) and define group search base.

6. **Configure Password Encoder**: Used **BCryptPasswordEncoder**  to handle LDAP-stored passwords, matching the encryption format in your LDAP directory.

7. **Test and Debug**: Test the LDAP authentication process, ensuring proper connection to the LDAP server and user authentication using valid credentials.
